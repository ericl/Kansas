Kansas lets friends share a virtual deck of cards across their phones.

The goal is to enable users to use their smartphone, tablet, or laptop
in place of any set of cards. Like in games using physical cards,
Kansas is designed under the assumption that players trust each other
and can negotiate rules and movements in person.

Kansas is a work in progress, and is currently being developed with Magic: The Gathering as a case study for usability.
